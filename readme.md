Red pieces, signified by asterisks around the unit letter.

The wavy horizontal line in the middle is the River, which the Elephant cannot cross.
Soldiers can only advance forward by one step per turn, until they cross the River.
After the crossing, they can also step sideways by one step per turn, but not backwards.

The 3-by-3 square containing the General and two Mandarins is the Palace. They cannot leave the Palace.
